Are you not sure whether your parents like pets or not? Leave your dog with them and watch them getting along. No, we aren’t joking because this is what Meghan Specksgoor has done when she visited New York to meet her dad. What actually happened was that when she went there, she started looking for someone who can take care of her 4-year-old dog, Chance. And surprisingly, she found the best candidate, her dad. Yes! 

Although Meghan was not sure about the entire thing in the beginning, then she started receiving surprising messages from the grey babysitter. She told us “they usually get along great.” She further added, “Chance is allowed to do whatever he wants with my dad – like an actual grandchild – and is given all sorts of treats the whole time he’s with him.”

We even asked Meghan about how she had met with Chance. To this, she told us that she met her at the Richmond Animal League (RAL). “I walked into [there] with a friend of mine who was looking for a puppy. And walked out with a completed application for ‘Chap.’ ‘Chap’ was brought to RAL with a shattered jaw from someone shooting him. We had surgery done to get a plate put in his jaw and he has been perfect ever since. He’s been re-named after my favorite rapper “Chance the Rapper,” and I thought it was fitting since he has been given a second chance at life.”</body>
