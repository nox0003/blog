<em><strong>They say that happiness is only real when shared. Adventures are always extra fun when you have your friends by your side, and who’s a better companion than man’s best friend?</strong></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While most retried professionals struggle to find a perfect way to pass time, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Bahnson, a retired orthopedic surgeon from Vermont is giving us some major retirement goals. He has found an adorable way to pass his free time and we are loving the idea. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">He designed a kayak so that he could take his Golden Retrievers, Susie; and Ginger, along with him on a ride.</span>

“They seem to love it, they get excited when we’d pull the kayaks out and see that we were going.”

Mr. Bahnson told The Dodo: ‘It’s like a triple kayak, only there isn’t enough room for the paddlers to put their feet — but it’s perfect for a dog. ‘They are trained to get in the kayak themselves on command. They sit down, and off we go. When we come ashore, they’ll stay seated until I tell them it’s OK to get out.

“I love my dogs. I love training them, the companionship. We’ve gone miles and miles of paddling with our dogs,” said Bahnson. “They just really enjoy going places,” he told the dodo.
