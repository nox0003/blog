If there is anything that new parents love more than their kid, it’s uploading their infinite pictures onto social media sites. OMG! Sometimes it really gets on our nerves and we end up thinking “how many pictures do they exactly click each day?’. But anyway, we should not blame them because they want to show the world the innocent face of their cute kid. C’mon even we like to show off when we do something amazing. So how can new parents resist themselves when they have brought a new life to this world? 

Although parents usually keep on posting their kid’s pictures everywhere, Nate Anderson thought of doing the same with a twist. A twist that is really cute and we guarantee, you won’t be irritated even after seeing 30 pictures. That’s right!

After the birth of Andreson’s first child Rowan, he thought of introducing his kid to the world but in a funny way. What he did that he started making webcomics of his kid with Golden Retriever. And the results are pretty adorable. This webcomic is called “Boy & Dog” and it is very cute. </body>
