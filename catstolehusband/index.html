How would you feel if someone tried to steal the love of your life? Well, you would be pretty jealous and mad. But not when a gorgeous feline is stealing your partner. This might sound a little weird to some people but it is true. Yes, this story is based on a real incident and it took place in Thailand. 

This whole thing got popular after Nasrin Hami, the wife posted a series of pictures of her husband and cat. In the pictures, you can clearly see how possessive the cat is for Nasrin’s husband. 

Once the post got noticed by Super Cats, a well-known Facebook page, it got more than thousands of likes. Also, the cat’s name is Jarvis and he is a Scottish Fold cat.
