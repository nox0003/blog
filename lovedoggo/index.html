People will come in and go out of your life but dogs won’t. They will protect you and your family until their last breath. Their hearts beat for you. When you come back from office, you’ll be welcomed by a fuzzy little bucket of joy, it can hardly contain that happiness. You feed them with your hands, they treat you like God. When you scratch their belly or pet them, they will put out their whole heart for you.

Sometimes we don’t deserve their unconditional love. We can try to be worthy of their love. Even if we fail, we won’t be less lovable for them. </body>
