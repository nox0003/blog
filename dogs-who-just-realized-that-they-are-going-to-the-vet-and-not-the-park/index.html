<span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there anything that a dog truly hates and doesn’t want to see? Um, you can take a wild guess. Have you figured out what we are talking about? Well, it’s the vet. If you have a dog, you might know how much he hates to go to a hospital. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how cleverly you take them to a vet, sooner or later they will realize that they are going to the worst</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> place they could ever imagine. And when they realize it, all they can think is how badly their humans have betrayed them. Awww poor babies! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it's a giant doggo or a tiny furry angel, no one likes hospitals. And the pictures that we have found are its proof. You can see in the pictures that the relationship of dogs with hospitals is anything but pleasing. And these poor babies are trying too hard to avoid the inevitable. </span>
