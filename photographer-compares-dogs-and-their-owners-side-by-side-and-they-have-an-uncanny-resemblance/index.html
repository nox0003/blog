<span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever heard the popular saying “Like owner, like a dog”? Well, this saying is absolutely true and we have got some pictures to prove it. This fun picture series of dogs and owners is created by British photographer Gerrard Gethings. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is a famous photographer and is known for his funny dog portraits. The best thing about the portraits is that they are so full of life and energy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But for his recent project, Gethings thought of doing something different and unique. That’s why he has paired the owner and dog together to show their similar appearance traits. This picture series is so amazing. All thanks to Gethings's hard work, talent, skill, and patience that makes each of these pictures different and funnier than others. </span>
